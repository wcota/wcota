👋 Hi! I'm Wesley Cota, a Ph.D. in Physics investigating both the fundamental aspects of epidemic spreading and their real-world applications. My research extends to understanding information propagation and the dynamics of echo chambers on social media.

🐧 I also have hands-on expertise in web server administration and scientific computational cluster management, all within the Linux ecosystem. I have experience in High-Performance Computing using Fortran and data science and analysis with Python, among other skills that bridge scientific research with software development.

🛠️ Some skills: High-Performance Computing (Fortran, C), Python (numpy, scipy, pandas, geopandas, sympy, and others), data mining and analysis, GIS, LaTeX, Bash, Linux, Docker, HTML, CSS, Javascript, NodeJS, NextJS, SQL, APIs
